# TASK-1 : Build an Alarm Clock.

The objective of our project is to implement an alarm clock using Python. 
Python consists of some very innovative libraries such as datetime and tkinter
which help us to build the project using the current date and time as well as to
provide a user interface to set the alarm according to the requirement in 24-hour format.


# TASK-2 : OTP Verification using Python

OTP Verification is the process of verifying a user by sending a unique password so that the 
user can be verified before completing a registration or payment process. Most of the time,
we get an OTP when we make an online payment, or when we forget our password, or when creating 
an account on any online platform. Thus, the sole purpose of an OTP is to verify the identity of a
user by sending a unique password. 
We can easily create an application for the task of OTP verification using Python by following the steps mentioned below: 
.First, create a 6-digit random number. 
.Then store the number in a variable 
.Then we need to write a program to send emails.
. When sending email, we need to use OTP as a message.
. Finally, we need to request two user inputs; first for the user’s email and then for the OTP that the user has received. 
So this is the complete process of creating an OTP verification application using Python.


# TASK-3 : URL Shortener with Python

You must have used various online URL shortening services and they all are doing a great job as well! Even Google forms 
also use shorten URLs for ease of use. So it’s a widely used service on the Internet.
Have you ever thought about or tried to shorten the length of the URL? Hopefully, there are plenty of libraries and
APIs available in the Python programming language to help us do the same using programming
